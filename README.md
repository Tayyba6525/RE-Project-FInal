# ArgoUML SPL
SPL migration of the [ArgoUML]([https://](https://github.com/argouml-tigris-org/argouml)) application using [Mobioos Forge]([https://](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage/publishers/mobioos))

## Start the Application and the Variants

### Prerequisites
The creation of the SPL has been achieved through the usage of [Mobioos Forge](https://documentation.mobioos.ai/). Consequently, to gain a comprehensive view of the FM and the SPL's maps, it is imperative to install Mobioos Forge within your [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) editor. The extension will also allow you to generate new variants. You can acquire the extension through VScode's built-in extension
explorer or by accessing it [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Mobioos.mobioos-forge).

Regarding ArgoUML, since it is a Java-based application, you need to have the Java JDK installed on your environment. Furthermore, you must have JDK 8 to be able to fully run the application and its unit tests (available [here](https://www.oracle.com/fr/java/technologies/javase/javase8-archive-downloads.html)).
You will also need to have [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) installed to easily build and run the application.

### Build and Launch The App
With a terminal, navigate to the root of this repository, then run the following Maven command:
> mvn clean package

This command will also execute the tests alongside building the app. If you want to save time and skip the tests, add the flag *-DskipTests* like so:
> mvn clean package -DskipTests

Once the app is fully built, you can start the generated JAR with the following command:
> java -jar ./src/argouml-build/target/argouml-jar-with-dependencies.jar

Now your app should be up and running!

## Feature Model
The image below illustrates the feature model of the ArgoUML SPL.
![feature Model](./images/fm.png)

The feature-model contains a total of 9 concrete features. Among those 9 features, 7 represent types of diagrams achievable within the application (*Class*, *State*, *Activity*, *Sequence*, *Use Case*, *Collaboration*, and *Deployment*). In addition to these 7 features, the feature-model also includes 2 features named *Cognitive Support* and *Logging*. *Cognitive Support*  offers insights to help diagram designers identify and resolve issues within their models. Logging, as the name implies, logs messages throughout the application's execution. All the features of the feature-model are optional, with the exception of *Class* which is mandatory.

In addition to these features, the feature model also incorporates the cross-tree constraint: *Activity â‡’ State*.
This cross-tree constraint was recommended to us by Mobioos Forge, which detected this dependency while we were mapping the features into the source code.

## Feature Mapping

The Table below shows data about the feature-mapping of the application.

## Variants

Several variants have been generated using MF's embedded variant derivation process. The Table below recaps the number of LOCs for those, the number of deleted lines relative to the original application's number of LOCs, and finally, the number of tests implemented in each variant.

### Variant Only *Class* enabled
The first variant introduced here is a variant where the only enabled feature is the mandatory one (*Class*).
The two next Figures show, the configuration used to generate the variant and its execution.

![Configuration of the variant Only Class enabled](./images/only-class/configuration.png)

![Execution of the variant Only Class enabled](./images/only-class/execution.png)

In this variant, the user can only create class diagrams. No insights are provided by the *Cognitive Support* feature and no logs are emitted during the execution.

### Variant *Class*, *State*, *Activity* and *Cognitive* enabled
This second variant has the features *Class*, *State*, *Activity* and *Cognitive* enabled. The two Figures below show, the configuration used to generate the variant and its execution.

![Configuration of the variant Class, State, Activity and Cognitive enabled](./images/class-state-activity-cognitive/configuration.png)

![Execution of the variant Class, State, Activity and Cognitive enabled](./images/class-state-activity-cognitive/execution.png)

Compared to the previous variant, this one includes activity and state diagrams in addition to the class diagram. Additionally, the "ToDo item" panel related to the *Cognitive Support* feature appears at the bottom of the UI. And just like in the previous variant, no logs are generated during the execution.

### Variant *Class*, *State*, *Deployment*, *Sequence* and *Logging* enabled
This third variant encompasses the features *Class*, *State*, *Deployment*, *Sequence* and *Logging*.
The two next Figures show, the configuration used to generate the variant and its execution.

![Configuration of the variant Class, State, Deployment, Sequence and Logging enabled](./images/class-state-deployment-sequence-logging/configuration.png)

![Execution of the variant Class, State, Deployment, Sequence and Logging enabled](./images/class-state-deployment-sequence-logging/execution.png)

This variant allows for the design of *Class*, *State*, *Deployment* and *Sequence* diagrams. Unlike the two previous variants, logs are generated during the execution.

### Variant *Class*, *Use Case* and *Collaboration* enabled
This fourth variant contains only the features *Class*, *Use Case* and *Collaboration*.
The two next Figures show, the configuration used to generate the variant and its execution.

![Configuration of the variant Class, Use Case and Collaboration enabled](./images/class-use-case-collaboration/configuration.png)

![Execution of the variant Class, Use Case and Collaboration enabled](./images/class-use-case-collaboration/execution.png)

This variant allows for the design of *Class*, *Use Case* and *Collaboration* diagrams. Both the     insights and the logs are disabled.

### Variant All diagrams enabled enabled
This last variant presented here encompasses all diagram types provided by ArgoUML. However, other non-diagram features are disabled. The two next Figures show, the configuration used to generate the variant and its execution.

![Configuration of the variant all diagrams enabled](./images/all-diagrams-enabled/configuration.png)

![Execution of the variant all diagrams enabled](./images/all-diagrams-enabled/execution.png)

This variant allows the user to design all the type of diagrams provided by ArgoUML. regarding the cognitive insights and the logs, both are disabled and do not appear while executing the variant.
